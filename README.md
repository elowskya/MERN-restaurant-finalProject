# Overview
This project started with a nextjs with strapi ecommerce starter:
 https://strapi.io/starters/strapi-starter-next-js-ecommerce

>Since this article was published, version 4 of Strapi has been released, so simply running the command from the website tutorial <code>npx create-strapi-starter my-project next-ecommerce</code>
 produces errors due to the installation script trying to pull version 4 of Strapi which this starter is not yet compatible with it. 

 >The Github repository for this project (<a href="https://github.com/strapi/strapi-starter-next-ecommerce">strapi-starter-next-ecommerce</a>) has an open issue for this and they recommended running:
<code>npx create-strapi-starter@3 my-project next-ecommerce</code>
to use version 3 of Strapi.
